# mbta-display

This application uses the [mbta's API](https://www.mbta.com/developers/v3-api) to display North Station's departures like so: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:North_Station_departure_board.JPG. As the data is retrieved from the mbta, AMTRACK departures are not shown. You can see the live version [here](https://mbta-display.herokuapp.com/).
